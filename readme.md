# Tenkey Mac Keyboard Layout

This is a Mac keyboard tenkey layout. You would typically toggle between a standard layout and this one. It is a nice companion for a layout like [ezSymbols](https://github.com/baldwindavid/ezsymbols).

The layout attempts to keep a number of keys used for the ten key in the place they are on the base typing layout.

## Installation

- Copy `tenkey.bundle` to `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/`
- Open `System Preferences` > `Keyboard`
- Click on `Input Sources`
- Click `+`
- Select `tenkey` under `English`
- You might need to login/logout for it to take

## Toggling Layouts

Input sources can be toggled back and forth on a Mac.

- Open `System Preferences` > `Keyboard`
- Click on `Shortcuts`
- Select `Input Sources`
- Check the box for `Select the previous input source`
- Set to your desired shortcut. I like `CMD+i` for "input source" and because my middle finger rests over it anyway
- Whichever are the last two keyboard layouts you've used can now be toggled back and forth. This would presumably your standard typing layout and the tenkey layout.

## FAQ

#### Q: What if I like the concept, but not this layout?
A: It is quite easy to create your own Mac layout using [Ukelele](https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ukelele)
